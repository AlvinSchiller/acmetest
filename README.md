(The openssl in CentOS 5 doesn't support ECDSA, so the ECDSA test cases failed. However, RSA certificates are working there.)

# How to run tests

First point at least 2 of your domains to your machine, 
for example: `aa.com` and `www.aa.com`

And make sure 80 port is not used by anyone else.

```
cd letest
TestingDomain=aa.com   TestingAltDomains=www.aa.com  ./letest.sh
```

# How to run tests in all the platforms through docker.

You must have docker installed, and also point 2 of your domains to your machine.

Then test all the platforms :

```
cd letest
TestingDomain=aa.com   TestingAltDomains=www.aa.com  ./rundocker.sh  testall
```

The script will download all the supported platforms from the official docker hub, then run the test cases in all the supported platforms.
